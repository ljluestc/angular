[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mgechev/memo-decorator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mgechev/memo-decorator)# Memo DecoratorThis decorator applies memoization to a method of a class.## UsageApply the decorator to a method of a class. The cache is local for the method but shared among all instances of the class. Strongly recommend you to **use this decorator only on pure methods.**Installation:```shellnpm i memo-decorator --save```### Configuration```tsexport interface Config {  resolver?: Resolver;  cache?: MapLike;}```- `Resolver` is a function, which returns the key to be used for given set of arguments. By default, the resolver will use the first argument of the method as the key.- `MapLike` is a cache instance. By default, the library would use `Map`.Example:```typescriptimport memo from 'memo-decorator';class Qux {  @memo({resolver: (...args: any[]) => args[1],cache: new WeakMap(),  })  foo(a: number, b: number) {return a * b;  }}```### Demo```typescriptimport memo from 'memo-decorator';class Qux {  @memo()  foo(a: number) {console.log('foo: called');return 42;  }  @memo({resolver: (_) => 1,  })  bar(a: number) {console.log('bar: called');return 42;  }}const a = new Qux();// Create a new cache entry and associate `1` with the result `42`.a.foo(1);// Do not invoke the original method `foo` because there's already a cache// entry for the key `1` associated with the result of the method.a.foo(1);// Invoke the original `foo` because the cache doesn't contain an entry// for the key `2`.a.foo(2);// Invoke `bar` and return the result `42` gotten from the original `bar` implementation.a.bar(1);// Does not invoke the original `bar` implementation because of the specified `resolver`// which is passed to `memo`. For any arguments of the function, the resolver will return// result `1` which will be used as the key.a.bar(2);const b = new Qux();// Does not invoke the method `foo` because there's already an entry// in the cache which associates the key `1` to the result `42` from the// invocation of the method `foo` by the instance `a`.b.foo(1);// Outputs:// foo: called// foo: called// bar: called```## LicenseMIT
