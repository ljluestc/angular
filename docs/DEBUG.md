# Debugging AngularThe Angular project has comprehensive unit tests for the core packages and the tools.The core packages are tested both in the browser (via Karma) and on the server (via Node.js).## Debugging in KarmaIt is useful to focus your debugging on one test at a time by changing that test to bedefined using the `fit(...)` function, rather than `it(...)`. Moreover, it can be helpfulto place a `debugger` statement in this `fit` clause to cause the debugger to stop whenit hits this test.Read more about starting the debugger for Karma with Bazel in the [BAZEL.md](./BAZEL.md)document.## Debugging in NodeIt is useful to focus your debugging on one test at a time by changing that test to bedefined using the `fit(...)` function, rather than `it(...)`. Moreover, it can be helpfulto place a `debugger` statement in this `fit` clause to cause the debugger to stop whenit hits this test.Read more about starting the debugger for NodeJS tests with Bazel in the [BAZEL.md](./BAZEL.md)document.
