# Building and Testing AngularThis document describes how to set up your development environment to build and test Angular.It also explains the basic mechanics of using `git`, `node`, and `yarn`.* [Prerequisite Software](#prerequisite-software)* [Getting the Sources](#getting-the-sources)* [Installing NPM Modules](#installing-npm-modules)* [Building](#building)* [Running Tests Locally](#running-tests-locally)* [Formatting your Source Code](#formatting-your-source-code)* [Linting/verifying your Source Code](#lintingverifying-your-source-code)* [Publishing Snapshot Builds](#publishing-snapshot-builds)* [Bazel Support](#bazel-support)See the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)if you'd like to contribute to Angular.## Prerequisite SoftwareBefore you can build and test Angular, you must install and configure thefollowing products on your development machine:* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and/or the [**GitHub app**](https://desktop.github.com/) (for Mac and Windows);  [GitHub's Guide to Installing Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) is a good source of information.\  **Windows Users**: Git Bash or an equivalent shell is required\  *Windows Powershell and cmd shells are not supported [#46780](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/46780) so some commands might fail** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), (version specified in the engines field of [`package.json`](../package.json)) which is used to run a development web server,  run tests, and generate distributable files.* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (version specified in the engines field of [`package.json`](../package.json)) which is used to install dependencies.* On Windows: [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) which is used by Bazel. Follow the [instructions](https://bazel.build/install/windows#installing-compilers-and-language-runtimes)* Optional: [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/) version 7 or higher than required by [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler). Most developers will not need this. Java is required for running some integration tests.## Getting the SourcesFork and clone the Angular repository:1. Login to your GitHub account or create one by following the instructions given   [here](https://github.com/signup/free).2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/forking) the [main Angular   repository](https://github.com/angular/angular).3. Clone your fork of the Angular repository and define an `upstream` remote pointing back to   the Angular repository that you forked in the first place.```shell# Clone your GitHub repository:git clone git@github.com:<github username>/angular.git# Go to the Angular directory:cd angular# Add the main Angular repository as an upstream remote to your repository:git remote add upstream https://github.com/angular/angular.git```## Installing NPM ModulesNext, install the JavaScript modules needed to build and test Angular:```shell# Install Angular project dependencies (package.json)yarn install```## BuildingTo build Angular run:```shellyarn build```* Results are put in the `dist/packages-dist` folder.## Running Tests LocallyBazel is used as the primary tool for building and testing Angular.To see how to run and debug Angular tests locally please refer to the Bazel [Testing Angular](./BAZEL.md#testing-angular) section.Note that you should execute all test suites before submitting a PR to GitHub (`yarn test //packages/...`).However, affected tests will be executed on our CI infrastructure. So if you forgot to run some affected tests which would fail, GitHub will indicate the error state and present you the failures.PRs can only be merged if the code is formatted properly and all tests are passing.<a name="formatting-your-source-code"><a name="clang-format"></a>### Testing changes against a local library/projectOften for developers the best way to ensure the changes they have made work as expected is to runuse changes in another library or project. To do this developers can build Angular locally, andusing `yarn link` build a local project with the created artifacts.This can be done by running:```shyarn ng-dev misc build-and-link <path-to-local-project-root>```### Building and serving a project#### CacheWhen making changes to Angular packages and testing in a local library/project you need to run `ng cache disable` to disable the Angular CLI disk cache. If you are making changes that are not reflected in your locally served library/project, verify if you have [CLI Cache](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#cache-options) disabled.#### Invoking the Angular CLIThe Angular CLI needs to be invoked using Node.js [`--preserve-symlinks`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--preserve-symlinks) flag. Otherwise the symbolic links will be resolved using their real path which causes node module resolution to fail.```shnode --preserve-symlinks --preserve-symlinks-main node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/init.js serve```## Formatting your source codeAngular uses [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the source code.If the source code is not properly formatted, the CI will fail and the PR cannot be merged.You can automatically format your code by running:- `yarn ng-dev format changed [shaOrRef]`: format only files changed since the provided sha/ref. `shaOrRef` defaults to `main`.- `yarn ng-dev format all`: format _all_ source code- `yarn ng-dev format files <files..>`: format only provided filesA better way is to set up your IDE to format the changed file on each file save.### VS Code1. Install [Clang-Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format) extension for VS Code.2. It will automatically pick up the settings from `.vscode/settings.json`.If you haven't already, create a `settings.json` file by following the instructions [here](../.vscode/README.md).### WebStorm / IntelliJ1. Install the [ClangFormatIJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8396-clangformatij) plugin1. Open `Preferences->Tools->clang-format`1. Find the field named "PATH"1. Add `<PATH_TO_YOUR_WORKSPACE>/angular/node_modules/clang-format/bin/<OS>/`  where the OS options are: `darwin_x64`, `linux_x64`, and `win32`.### Vim1. Install [Vim Clang-Format](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-clang-format).2. Create a [project-specific `.vimrc`](https://andrew.stwrt.ca/posts/project-specific-vimrc/) in   your Angular directory containing```vimlet g:clang_format#command = '$ANGULAR_PATH/node_modules/.bin/clang-format'```where `$ANGULAR_PATH` is an environment variable of the absolute path of your Angular directory.## Linting/verifying your Source CodeYou can check that your code is properly formatted and adheres to coding style by running:``` shell$ yarn lint```## Publishing Snapshot BuildsWhen a build of any branch on the upstream fork angular/angular is green on CircleCI, itautomatically publishes build artifacts to repositories in the Angular org. For example,the `@angular/core` package is published to https://github.com/angular/core-builds.You may find that your un-merged change needs some validation from external participants.Rather than requiring them to pull your Pull Request and build Angular locally, they can depend onsnapshots of the Angular packages created based on the code in the Pull Request.### Getting Packages from Build ArtifactsEach CI run for a Pull Request stores the built Angular packages as[build artifacts](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts). The artifacts are not guaranteed to beavailable as a long-term distribution mechanism, but they are guaranteed to be available around thetime of the build.You can access the artifacts for a specific CI run by going to the workflow page, clicking on the`publish_packages_as_artifacts` job and then switching to the "ARTIFACTS" tab.#### Archives for each PackageOn the "Artifacts" tab, there is a list of links to compressed archives for Angular packages. Thearchive names are of the format `<package-name>-pr<pr-number>-<sha>.tgz` (for example`core-pr12345-a1b2c3d.tgz`).One can use the URL to the `.tgz` file for each package to install them as dependencies in aproject they need to test the Pull Request changes against. Both[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install.html) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/add)support installing dependencies from URLs to `.tgz` files, for example by updating the dependenciesin `package.json` to point to the artifact URLs and then running `npm/yarn install`:```json"dependencies": {  "@angular/common": "https://<...>.circle-artifacts.com/0/angular/common-pr12345-a1b2c3d.tgz",  "@angular/core": "https://<...>.circle-artifacts.com/0/angular/core-pr12345-a1b2c3d.tgz",  "...": "..."}```#### Download all PackagesIn addition to the individual package archives, a `.tgz` file including all packages is alsoavailable (named `all-pr<pr-number>-<sha>.tgz`). This can be used if one prefers to download allpackages locally and test them by either of the following ways:1. Update the dependencies in `package.json` to point to the local uncompressed package directories.2. Directly copy the local uncompressed package directories into the `node_modules/` directory of a   project.Note that (while faster) the second approach has limitations. For example:a. Any transitive dependencies of the copied packages will not be automatically updated.b. The packages need to be copied over every time `npm/yarn install` is run.c. Some package managers (such as `pnpm` or `yarn pnp`) might not work correctly.### Publishing to GitHub ReposYou can also manually publish `*-builds` snapshots just like our CircleCI build does for upstreambuilds. Before being able to publish the packages, you need to build them locally by running the`yarn build` command.First time, you need to create the GitHub repositories:``` shell$ export TOKEN=[get one from https://github.com/settings/tokens]$ CREATE_REPOS=1 ./scripts/ci/publish-build-artifacts.sh [GitHub username]```For subsequent snapshots, just run:``` shell$ ./scripts/ci/publish-build-artifacts.sh [GitHub username]```The script will publish the build snapshot to a branch with the same name as your current branch,and create it if it doesn't exist.## Bazel Support### IDEs#### VS Code1. Install [Bazel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DevonDCarew.bazel-code) extension for VS Code.#### WebStorm / IntelliJ1. Install the [Bazel](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8609-bazel) plugin1. You can find the settings under `Preferences->Other Settings->Bazel Settings`It will automatically recognize `*.bazel` and `*.bzl` files.### Remote Build Execution and Remote CachingBazel builds in the Angular repository use a shared cache. When a build occurs a hash of the inputs is computedand checked against available outputs in the shared cache. If an output is found, it is used as the output for thebuild action rather than performing the build locally.> Remote Build Execution requires authentication as a google.com account.#### --config=remote flagThe `--config=remote` flag can be added to enable remote execution of builds.
