<a name="conversation-locking"></a># Automatic conversation lockingClosed issues and pull requests are locked automatically after 30 days of inactivity.## I want to comment on a locked conversation, what should I do?When an issue has been closed and inactive for over 30 days, the original context is likely outdated.If you encounter a similar or related issue in the current version, please open a new issue andprovide up-to-date reproduction instructions.## Why lock conversations?Automatically locking closed, inactive issues guides people towards filing new issues with updatedcontext rather than commenting on a "resolved" issue that contains out-of-date or unrelatedinformation. As an example, someone may comment "I'm still having this issue", but withoutproviding any of the additional information the team needs to investigate.<a name="feature-request"></a># Feature request processTo manage the requests we receive at scale, we introduced automation in our feature requestmanagement process. After we triage an issue and we identify it as a feature request, it goesthrough several steps.## Manual reviewFirst, we manually review the issue to see if it aligns with any of the existing roadmap efforts. Ifit does, we prioritize it accordingly. Alternatively, we keep it open and our feature request botinitiates a voting process.## Voting phaseTo include the community in the feature request process, we open voting for a fixed length of time.Anyone can cast a vote for the request with a thumbs-up (üëç) reaction on the original issue description.When a feature request reaches 20 or more upvotes, we formally consider the feature request.Alternatively, the bot closes the request.**For issues that are 60+ days old**: The voting phase is 20 days**For new issues**: The voting phase is 60 days## Consideration phaseIf the feature request receives 20 or more thumbs-up (üëç) votes on the original issue description(during the voting phase described above), we verify the Angular team can afford to maintain thefeature and whether it aligns with the long-term vision of Angular. If the answers to both of thesequestions are yes, we prioritize the request, alternatively we close it with an explanation of ourdecision.## Diagram<p align="center" width="100%">  <img src="./images/feature-request-automation.png" alt="Feature Request Automation"></p>## What if I want to implement the feature to help the Angular team?Often implementing the feature as a separate package is a better option. Building an externalpackage rather than including the functionality in Angular helps with:- Keeping the framework's runtime smaller and simpler- Makes the learning journey of developers getting started with Angular smoother- Reduces maintainers burden and the complexity of the source code
