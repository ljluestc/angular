## General Notes  * `(array)` VM object where the array is actually stored in: 38 bytesEach Object cost is 24 bytes plus 8 bytes per property.For small arrays, it is more efficient to store the data as a linked listof items rather than small arrays. However, the array access is faster asshown here: https://jsperf.com/small-arrays-vs-linked-objects## Monomor- [Impact of polymorphism on component-based frameworks- type of elements in the array;- presence of holes (indexes that were never assigned).Generally speaking packed arrays (a set of continuous, initialized indexes) perform better as compared to arrays with holes. To assure that arrays are packed follow those guidelines:* create array literals with known values whenever possible (* don't delete elements from an ar- [Elements kinds in V8](https://v8.dev/blog/elements-kinds)## Exporting top level variablesExporting top level variables should be avoided where possible where performanceand code size matters:```// Typescriptlet notExported = 0;notExported = exported;// Would be compiled toexports.exported = 0;```Most minifiers do not rename properties (closure is an exception here).Whatexport function setExportover properties of an object.```for (var i = 0, keys = Object.keys(obj); i < keys.length; i++) {  const key = keys[i];```## Recursive functionsAvoid recursive functions when possible because they cannot be inlined.https://jsperf.com/cost-of-recursion## Function InliningVMs gain a lot of speed by inlining functions which are small (such as getters).This is because the cost of the value retrieval (getter) is often way less than the cost of making a function call.VMs use the heuristic of size to determine whether a function Here is an example of code which breaks the inlining and a way to fix it.```export function i18nStart(index: number, message: string, su  if (tView.firstCreatePass && t  }}The application would benefit from inlining, but the large code inside `if` prevents it.Simple refactoring will fix it.```export function i18nStart(index: number, message: string, subTemplateIndex?: number): void {  const tView = getT    i18nStartfirstCreat}export function i18nStartfirstCreatePass(tView: TView, index: number, message: string, subTemplateIndex?: number): void {  // LOTS OF CODE HE```## LoopsDon
