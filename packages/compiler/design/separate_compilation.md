# DESIGN DOC (Ivy): Separate CompilationAUTHOR: chuckj@## Background### Angular 5 (Renderer2)In 5.0 and prior versions of Angular the compiler performs whole programanalysis and generates template and injector definitions that usethis global knowledge to flatten injector scope definitions, inlinedirectives into the component, pre-calculate queries, pre-calculatecontent projection, etc. This global knowledge requires that module andcomponent factories are generated as the final global step when compilinga module. If any of the transitive information changed, then all factoriesneed to be regenerated.Separate component and module compilation is supported only at the moduledefinition level and only from the source. That is, npm packages must containthe metadata necessary to generate the factories. They cannot contain,themselves, the generated factories. This is because if any of theirdependencies change, their factories would be invalid, preventing them fromusing version ranges in their dependencies. To support producing factoriesfrom compiled source (already translated by TypeScript into JavaScript)libraries include metadata that describe the content of the Angulardecorators.This document refers to this style of code generation as Renderer2 (after thename of the renderer class it uses at runtime).### Angular IvyIn Ivy, the runtime is crafted in a way that allows for separate compilationby performing at runtime much of what was previously pre-calculated bythe compiler. This allows the definition of components to change withoutrequiring modules and components that depend on them to be recompiled.The mental model of Ivy is that the decorator is the compiler. That is,the decorator can be thought of as parameters to a class transformer thattransforms the class by generating definitions based on the decoratorparameters. A `@Component` decorator transforms the class by addingan `ɵcmp` static property, `@Directive` adds `ɵdir`,`@Pipe` adds `ɵpipe`, etc. In most cases the values supplied to thedecorator are sufficient to generate the definition. However, in the case ofinterpreting the template, the compiler needs to know the selector defined foreach component, directive and pipe that are in the scope of the template. Thepurpose of this document is to define the information that is needed by thecompiler, and how that information is serialized to be discovered andused by subsequent calls to `ngc`.This document refers to this style of code generation as Ivy (after the codename of the project to create it). It would be more consistent to refer to itas Renderer3, but that looks too similar to Renderer2.## Information neededThe information available across compilations in Angular 5 is represented inthe  compiler by a summary description. For example, components and directivesare represented by the [`CompileDirectiveSummary`](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/d3827a0017fd5ff5ac0f6de8a19692ce47bf91b4/packages/compiler/src/compile_metadata.ts#L257).The following table shows where this information ends up in an ivy compiledclass:### `CompileDirectiveSummary`| field| destination||---------------------|-----------------------|| `type`   | implicit   || `isComponent`mp` || `selector`| `ngModuleScope`| `exportAs`| `ɵdir` || `inputs` | `ɵdir` || `outputs`| `ɵdir` || `hostListeners`     | `ɵdir` || `hostProperties`    | `ɵdir` || `hostAttributes`    | `ɵdir` || `providers`|| `viewProviders`     | `ɵcmp` || `queries`| `ɵdir` || `guards` | not used   || `viewQueries`mp` || `changeDetection`   | `ɵcmp` || `template`| `ɵcmp` || `componentViewType` | not used   || `renderType`t used   || `componentFactory`  | not used   |Only one definition is generated per class. All components are directives so a`ɵcmp` contains all the `ɵdir` information. All directivesare injectable so `ɵcmp` and `ɵdir` contain `ɵprov`information.For `CompilePipeSummary` the table looks like:#### `CompilePipeSummary`| field| destination||---------------------|-----------------------|| `type`   | implicit   || `name`   | `ngModuleScope`| `pure`   | `ɵpipe`|The only pieces of information that are not generated into the definition arethe directive selector and the pipe name as they go into the module scope.The information needed to build an `ngModuleScope` needs to be communicatedfrom the directive and pipe to the module that declares them.## Metadata### Angular 5Angular 5 uses `.metadata.json` files to store information that is directlyinferred from the `.ts` files and include value information that is notincluded in the `.d.ts` file produced by TypeScript. Because only exports fortypes are included in `.d.ts` files and might not include the exports necessaryfor values, the metadata includes export clauses from the `.ts` file.When a module is flattened into a FESM (Flat ECMAScript Module), a flatmetadata file is also produced which is the metadata for all symbols exportedfrom the module index. The metadata represents what the `.metadata.json` filewould look like if all the symbols were declared in the index instead ofreexported from the index.### Angular IvyThe metadata for a class in ivy is transformed to be what the metadata of thetransformed .js file produced by the Ivy compiler would be. For example, acomponent's `@Component` is removed by the compiler and replaced by a `ɵcmp`.The `.metadata.json` file is similarly transformed but the content of thevalue assigned is elided (e.g. `"ɵcmp": {}`). The compiler doesn'trecord the selector declared for a component but it is needed to produce the`ngModuleScope` so the information is recorded as if a static field`ngSelector` was declared on class with the value of the `selector` fieldfrom the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator.The following transformations are performed:#### `@Component`The metadata for a component is transformed by:1. Removing the `@Component` directive.2. Add  `"ɵcmp": {}` static field.3. Add `"ngSelector": <selector-value>` static field.##### Example*my.component.ts*```ts@Component({  selector: 'my-comp',  template: `<h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>`})export class MyComponent {  @Input() name: string;}```*my.component.js*```jsexport class MyComponent {  name: string;  static ɵcmp = ɵɵdefineComponent({...});}```*my.component.metadata.json*```json{  "__symbolic": "module",  "version": 4,  "metadata": {    "MyComponent": {bolic": "class",cs": {p": {},elector": "my-comp"    }  }}```Note that this is exactly what is produced if the transform had been donemanually or by some other compiler before `ngc` compiler is invoked. That is whythis model has the advantage that there is no magic introduced by the compiler,as it treats classes annotated by `@Component` identically to those producedmanually.#### `@Directive`The metadata for a directive is transformed by:1. Removing the `@Directive` directive.2. Add  `"ɵdir": {}` static field.3. Add `"ngSelector": <selector-value>` static field.##### example*my.directive.ts*```ts@Directive({selector: '[my-dir]'})export class MyDirective {  @HostBinding('id') dirId = 'some id';}```*my.directive.js*```jsexport class MyDirective {  constructor() {    this.dirId = 'some id';  }  static ɵdir = ɵɵdefineDirective({...});}```*my.directive.metadata.json*```json{  "__symbolic": "module",  "version": 4,  "metadata": {    "MyDirective": {bolic": "class",cs": {r": {},elector": "[my-dir]"    }  }}```#### `@Pipe`The metadata for a pipe is transformed by:1. Removing the `@Pipe` directive.2. Add  `"ɵpipe": {}` static field.3. Add `"ngSelector": <name-value>` static field.##### example*my.pipe.ts*```ts@Pipe({name: 'myPipe'})export class MyPipe implements PipeTransform {  transform(...) ...}```*my.pipe.js*```jsexport class MyPipe {  transform(...) ...  static ɵpipe = ɵɵdefinePipe({...});}```*my.pipe.metadata.json*```json{  "__symbolic": "module",  "version": 4,  "metadata": {    "MyPipe": {bolic": "class",cs": {pe": {},elector": "myPipe"    }  }}```#### `@NgModule`The metadata for a module is transformed by:1. Remove the `@NgModule` directive.2. Add  `"ɵinj": {}` static field.3. Add `"ngModuleScope": <module-scope>` static field.The scope value is an array the following type:```tsexport type ModuleScope = ModuleScopeEntry[];export interface ModuleDirectiveEntry {  type: Type;  selector: string;}export interface ModulePipeEntry {  type: Type;  name: string;  isPipe: true;}export interface ModuleExportEntry {  type: Type;  isModule: true;}type ModuleScopeEntry = ModuleDirectiveEntry | ModulePipeEntry | ModuleExportEntry;```where the `type` values are generated as references.##### example*my.module.ts*```ts@NgModule({  imports: [CommonModule, UtilityModule],  declarations: [MyComponent, MyDirective, MyPipe],  exports: [MyComponent, MyDirective, MyPipe, UtilityModule],  providers: [{    provide: Service, useClass: ServiceImpl  }]})export class MyModule {}```*my.module.js*```jsexport class MyModule {  static ɵinj = ɵɵdefineInjector(...);}```*my.module.metadata.json*```json{  "__symbolic": "module",  "version": 4,  "metadata": {    "MyModule": {bolic": "class",cs": {j": {},oduleScope": [{ "type": {   "__symbolic": "reference",   "module": "./my.component",   "name": "MyComponent" }, "selector": "my-comp"},{ "type": {   "__symbolic": "reference",   "module": "./my.directive",   "name": "MyDirective" }, "selector": "[my-dir]"},{ "type": {   "__symbolic": "reference",   "module": "./my.pipe",   "name": "MyPipe" }, "name": "myPipe", "isPipe": true},{ "type": {   "__symbolic": "reference",   "module": "./utility.module",   "name": "UtilityModule" }, "isModule": true}    }  }}```Note that this is identical to what would have been generated if the this wasmanually written as:```tsexport class MyModule {  static ɵinj = ɵɵdefineInjector({    providers: [{e: Service, useClass: ServiceImpl    }],    imports: [CommonModule, UtilityModule]  });  static ngModuleScope = [{    type: MyComponent,    selector: 'my-comp'  }, {    type: MyDirective,    selector: '[my-dir]'  }, {    type: MyPipe,    name: 'myPipe'  }, {    type: UtilityModule,    isModule: true  }];}```except for the call to `ɵɵdefineInjector` would generate a `{ __symbolic: 'error' }`value which is ignored by the ivy compiler. This allows the system to ignorethe difference between manually and mechanically created module definitions.## `ngc` output (non-Bazel)The cases that `ngc` handle are producing an application and producing areusable library used in an application.### Application outputThe output of the Ivy compiler only optionally generates the factoriesgenerated by the Renderer2 style output of Angular 5.0. In Ivy, the informationthat was generated in factories is now generated in Angular as a definitionthat is generated as a static field in the Angular decorated class.Renderer2 requires that, when building the final application, all factories forall libraries also be generated. In Ivy, the definitions are generated whenthe library is compiled.The Ivy compile can adapt Renderer2 target libraries by generating the factoriesfor them and back-patching, at runtime, the static property into the class.#### Back-patching module (`"renderer2BackPatching"`)When an application contains Renderer2 target libraries the Ivy definitionsneed to be back-patch onto the component, directive, module, pipe, andinjectable classes.If the Angular compiler option `"renderer2BackPatching"` is enabled, thecompiler will generate an `angular.back-patch` module into the root outputdirectory of the project. If `"generateRenderer2Factories"` is set to `true`then the default value for `"renderer2BackPatching"` is `true` and it is anerror for it to be `false`. `"renderer2BackPatching"` is ignored if `"enableIvy"`is `false`.`angular.back-patch` exports a function per `@NgModule` for the entireapplication, including previously compiled libraries. The name of the functionis determined by name of the imported module with all non alphanumericcharacter, including '`/`' and '`.`', replaced by '`_`'.The back-patch functions will call the back-patch function of any module theyimport. This means that only the application's module and lazy loaded modulesback-patching functions need to be called. If using the Renderer2 module factoryinstances, this is performed automatically when the first application moduleinstance is created.#### Renderer2 Factories (`"generateRenderer2Factories"`)`ngc` can generate an implementation of `NgModuleFactory` in the same locationthat Angular 5.0 would generate it. This implementation of `NgModuleFactory`will back-patch the Renderer2 style classes when the first module instance iscreated by calling the correct back-patching function generated in the`angular.back-patch`module.Renderer2 style factories are created when the `"generateRenderer2Factories"`Angular compiler option is `true`. Setting `"generateRenderer2Factories"` implies`"renderer2BackPatching"` is also `true` and it is an error to explicitly set itto `false`. `"generateRenderer2Factories"` is ignored if `"enableIvy"` is`false`.When this option is `true` a factory module is created with the same public APIat the same location as Angular 5.0 whenever Angular 5.0 would have generated afactory.### Recommended optionsThe recommended options for producing an ivy application are| option| value    |  ||--------------------------------|----------|-------------|| `"enableIvy"`   | `true`   | required    || `"generateRenderer2Factories"` | `true`   | implied     || `"renderer2BackPatching"`e`   | implied     || `"generateCodeForLibraries"`   | `true`   | default     || `"annotationsAs"`   | `remove` | implied     || `"preserveWhitespaces"`alse`  | default     || `"skipMetadataEmit"`| `true`   | default     || `"strictMetadataEmit"`  | implied     || `"skipTemplateCodegen"`gnored     |The options marked "implied" are implied by other options having therecommended value and do not need to be explicitly set. Options marked"default" also do not need to be set explicitly.## Library outputBuilding an Ivy library with `ngc` differs from Renderer2 in that thedeclarations are included in the generated output and should be included in thepackage published to `npm`. The `.metadata.json` files still need to beincluded but they are transformed as described below.### Transforming metadataAs described above, when the compiler adds the declaration to the class it willalso transform the `.metadata.json` file to reflect the new static fields addedto the class.Once the static fields are added to the metadata, the Ivy compiler no longerneeds the information in the decorator. When `"enableIvy"` is `true` thisinformation is removed from the `.metadata.json` file.### Recommended optionsThe recommended options for producing a ivy library are:| option| value    |  ||--------------------------------|----------|-------------|| `"enableIvy"`   | `true`   | required    || `"generateRenderer2Factories"` | `false`  |  || `"renderer2BackPatching"`se`  | default     || `"generateCodeForLibraries"`   | `false`  |  || `"annotationsAs"`   | `remove` | implied     || `"preserveWhitespaces"`alse`  | default     || `"skipMetadataEmit"`| `false`  |  || `"strictMetadataEmit"`  |  || `"skipTemplateCodegen"`gnored     |The options marked "implied" are implied by other options having therecommended value and do not need to be explicitly set. Options marked"default" also do not need to be set explicitly.## Simplified optionsThe default Angular Compiler options default to, mostly, the recommended set ofoptions but the options necessary to set for specific targets are not clear andmixing them can produce nonsensical results. The `"target"` option can be usedto simplify the setting of the compiler options to the recommended valuesdepending on the target:| target | option| value|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|-------------|| `"application"`   | `"generateRenderer2Factories"` | `true`orced    ||    | `"renderer2BackPatching"`e` | enf   ||    | `"generateCodeForLibraries"`   | `true`|    | `"annotationsAs"`   | `remove`     |  ||    | `"preserveWhitespaces"`alse`|  ||    | `"skipMetadataEmit"`| `false`|    | `"strictMetadataEmit"`|    | `"skipTemplateCodegen"`alse`|  ||    | `"fullTemplateTypeCheck"`e` |  ||    |  |   |  || `"library"`enerateRenderer2Factories"` | `false`| enfo  ||    | `"renderer2BackPatching"`se`| enfo  ||    | `"generateCodeForLibraries"`   | `false`rced    ||    | `"annotationsAs"`   | `decorators` |  ||    | `"preserveWhitespaces"`alse`|  ||    | `"skipMetadataEmit"`| `false`rced    ||    | `"strictMetadataEmit"`|    | `"skipTemplateCodegen"`alse`| enfo  ||    | `"fullTemplateTypeCheck"`e` |  ||    |  |   |  || `"package"`latModuleOutFile"`|   | required    ||    | `"flatModuleId"`|   | required    ||    | `"enableIvy"`   | `false`rced    ||    | `"generateRenderer2Factories"` | `false`rced    ||    | `"renderer2BackPatching"`se`| enfo  ||    | `"generateCodeForLibraries"`   | `false`rced    ||    | `"annotationsAs"`   | `remove`     |  ||    | `"preserveWhitespaces"`alse`|  ||    | `"skipMetadataEmit"`| `false`rced    ||    | `"strictMetadataEmit"`|    | `"skipTemplateCodegen"`alse`| enfo  ||    | `"fullTemplateTypeCheck"`e` |  |Options that are marked "enforced" are reported as an error if they areexplicitly set to a value different from what is specified here. The optionsmarked "required" are required to be set and an error message is displayed ifno value is supplied but no default is provided.The purpose of the "application" target is for the options used when the `ngc`invocation contains the root application module. Lazy loaded modules shouldalso be considered "application" targets.The purpose of the "library" target is for are all `ngc` invocations that donot contain the root application module or a lazy loaded module.The purpose of the "package" target is to produce a library package that willbe an entry point for an npm package. Each entry point should be separatelycompiled using a "package" target.##### Example - applicationTo produce a Renderer2 application the options would look like,```json{  "compileOptions": {    ...  },  "angularCompilerOptions": {    "target": "application"  }}```alternately, since the recommended `"application"` options are the defaultvalues, the `"angularCompilerOptions"` can be out.##### Example - libraryTo produce a Renderer2 library the options would look like,```json{  "compileOptions": {    ...  },  "angularCompilerOptions": {    "target": "library"  }}```##### Example - packageTo produce a Renderer2 package the options would look like,```json{  "compileOptions": {    ...  },  "angularCompilerOptions": {    "target": "package"  }}```##### Example - Ivy applicationTo produce an Ivy application the options would look like,```json{  "compileOptions": {    ...  },  "angularCompilerOptions": {    "target": "application",    "enableIvy": true  }}```##### Example - Ivy libraryTo produce an Ivy library the options would look like,```json{  "compileOptions": {    ...  },  "angularCompilerOptions": {    "target": "library",    "enableIvy": true  }}```##### Example - Ivy packageIvy packages are not supported in Angular 6.0 as they are not recommended innpm packages as they would only be usable if inside Ivy applications.Ivy applications support Renderer2 libraries so npm packagesshould all be Renderer2 libraries.## `ng_module` output (Bazel)The `ng_module` rule describes the source necessary to produce a Angularlibrary that is reusable and composable into an application.### Angular 5.0The `ng_module` rule invokes `ngc`[<sup>1<sup>](#ngc_wrapped) to producethe Angular output. However, `ng_module` uses a feature, the `.ngsummary.json`file, not normally used and is often difficult to configure correctly.The `.ngsummary.json` describes all the information that is necessary forthe compiler to use a generated factory. It is produced by actions definedin the `ng_module` rule and is consumed by actions defined by `ng_module`rules that depend on other `ng_module` rules.### Angular IvyThe `ng_module` rule will still use `ngc` to produce the Angular output but,when producing ivy output, it no longer will need the `.ngsummary.json` file.#### `ng_experimental_ivy_srcs`The `ng_experimental_ivy_srcs` can be used as use to cause the ivy versions offiles to be generated. It is intended the sole dependency of a `ts_dev_server`rule and the `ts_dev_server` sources move to `ng_experimental_iv_srcs`.#### `ng_module` Ivy outputThe `ng_module` is able to provide the Ivy version of the `.js` files whichwill be generated with as `.ivy.js` for the development sources and `.ivy.mjs`for the production sources.The `ng_module` rule will also generate a `angular.back_patch.js` and `.mjs`files and a `module_scope.json` file. The type of the `module_scope.json` file willbe:```tsinterface ModuleScopeSummary {  [moduleName: string]: ModuleScopeEntry[];}```where `moduleName` is the name of the as it would appear in an import statementin a `.ts` file at the same relative location in the source tree. All thereferences in this file are also relative to this location.##### ExampleThe following is a typical Angular application build in bazel:*src/BUILD.bazel*```pyng_module(  name = "src",  srcs = glob(["*.ts"]),  deps= ["//common/component"],)ts_dev_server(  name = "server",  srcs = ":src",)```To use produce an Ivy version you would add:```pyng_experimental_ivy_srcs(  name = "ivy_srcs",  srcs = ":src",)ts_dev_server(  name = "server_ivy",  srcs = [":ivy_srcs"])```To serve the Renderer2 version, you would run:```shbazel run :server```to serve the Ivy version you would run```shbazel run :server_ivy```The `ng_experimental_ivy_srcs` rule is only needed when Ivy is experimental. Once Ivyis released, the `ng_experimental_ivy_srcs` dependent rules can be removed.---<a name="myfootnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> More correctly, it calls `performCompilation`from the `@angular/compiler-cli` which is what `ngc` does too.
