# @angular/localize schematic for `ng add`This schematic will be executed when an Angular CLI user runs `ng add @angular/localize`.It will search their `angular.json` file, and add `types: ["@angular/localize"]` in the TypeScriptconfiguration files of the project.If the user specifies that they want to use `$localize` at runtime then the dependency will beadded to the `dependencies` section of `package.json` rather than in the `devDependencies` whichis the default.
